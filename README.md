# Automatic Pet Feeder – Final Project

## Overview
This project is an **automatic pet food dispenser** designed and implemented as a final project.  
The system automates the process of dispensing pet food and water using multiple embedded subsystems controlled by an Arduino.

The main Arduino file for the project is the **pet feeder**, which integrates all subsystems into a single working system.

---

## System Description
The automatic pet feeder is composed of several **independent subsystems**, each responsible for a specific function. These subsystems work together to ensure accurate food dispensing and water delivery.

### Subsystems Included
- **Water Pump System**  
  Controls the dispensing of water using a water pump.

- **Load Cell with IR Sensor and H-Bridge**  
  Measures the amount of food dispensed using a load cell, with an IR sensor for detection and an H-bridge for motor control.

- **Screw Feeder with Stepper Motor**  
  Dispenses dry pet food accurately using a screw feeder mechanism driven by a stepper motor.
